# Interactive-Proximity-Sensor
In my 2nd year prototyping class, ECE 298, my partner and I created a device to sample real-time data to determine the distance between it and nearby objects. Our project made use of a Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller connected with an ultrasonic sensor, a keypad, and three LEDs. The device continuously sampled data from the ultrasonic sensor to calculate the distance between itself and nearby objects. Once calculated, the data is then displayed to the user using the LCD and either a red, yellow, or green LED will be turned on depending on the range under which the distance falls. These ranges can be programmed by a user using the attached keypad.
